        "\n",
        "This report presents a comprehensive analysis and cleaning pipeline for 3D pollen models reconstructed from orthogonal 2D images. We investigate the geometric integrity, spectral properties, and topological structure of the meshes using a series of experiments. Additionally, a full cleaning pipeline is provided to repair, normalize, and prepare the meshes for downstream applications such as machine learning, 3D printing, or visualization. The notebook is a explorative experimentation of the methods, its not for production use intended instead to legitimate the methods and the pipeline. The code is not optimized for performance, but rather for clarity and understanding of the methods used.\n",
        "The analysis is structured around five key experiments: watertightness assessment, Fourier analysis, convex hull analysis, graph Laplacian spectrum analysis, and shape distribution analysis. Each experiment is designed to provide insights into the structural characteristics of the pollen models, identify potential issues, and facilitate the cleaning process. The results of the analyses are visualized and discussed to highlight key findings and implications for future work.\n",

        "\n",
        "Accurate 3D reconstruction of pollen from 2D images is crucial for understanding their structural characteristics. However, models obtained through such processes may contain reconstruction errors, missing data, or topological inconsistencies. This notebook outlines a systematic approach to:\n",

        "- Assess the watertightness of the meshes.\n",
        "- Analyze structural features via Fourier (spectral) decomposition.\n",
        "- Evaluate geometric complexity through convex hull and graph Laplacian spectrum analyses.\n",
        "- Statistically characterize the shape using the D2 shape function.\n",
        "- Execute a full cleaning pipeline to repair and normalize the meshes.\n",
